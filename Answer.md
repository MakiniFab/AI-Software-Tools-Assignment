1. What is TensorFlow, and what are its key features?
TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning framework developed by Google for building and deploying deep learning models.

Key Features:

Supports both CPU and GPU acceleration.

Provides automatic differentiation for gradient-based optimization.

Offers TensorBoard for visualization.

Uses Keras as a high-level API.

Supports distributed training for scalability.

2. What is the main difference between TensorFlow and PyTorch in terms of computation graphs?
TensorFlow uses static computation graphs, requiring the graph to be defined first and then executed.
PyTorch uses dynamic computation graphs, allowing for on-the-fly modifications, making it more flexible and intuitive for debugging.

3. What is Keras, and on which frameworks can it run?
Keras is a high-level deep learning API that simplifies the implementation of neural networks.

It can run on:

TensorFlow (default backend).

Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (CNTK) (deprecated).

Theano (no longer maintained).

PlaidML (for OpenCL support).

4. What are the key features of Scikit-learn?
Scikit-learn is a Python library for machine learning, built on NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib.

Key Features:

Supports supervised and unsupervised learning.

Provides classification, regression, and clustering models.

Includes feature extraction and preprocessing tools.

Supports cross-validation and model evaluation.

5. What is the purpose of Jupyter Notebooks, and what are its key features?
Jupyter Notebook is an open-source interactive computing environment that allows users to write and execute code in notebook format.

Key Features:

Supports multiple programming languages (Python, R, Julia).

Allows live code execution and visualization.

Supports Markdown for documentation.

Integrates with Matplotlib, TensorFlow, and PyTorch for AI/ML.

6. In the TensorFlow example provided, what is the purpose of the Dropout layer in the neural network?
The Dropout layer is used to reduce overfitting by randomly dropping some neurons during training, preventing the model from relying too much on specific neurons.

7. What is the role of the optimizer in the PyTorch example, and which optimizer is used?
The optimizer updates model parameters to minimize the loss function.
Adam optimizer is commonly used for its adaptive learning rates and fast convergence.

8. In the Keras example, what is the purpose of the Conv2D layer?
Conv2D is a convolutional layer used in CNNs to detect spatial features such as edges, textures, and patterns in images.

9. What type of model is used in the Scikit-learn example, and what dataset is it applied to?
Logistic Regression model.
Applied to the Iris dataset (commonly used for classification tasks).

10. What is the output of the Jupyter Notebook example, and which library is used to generate the visualization?
The output is a graph/plot.
Matplotlib or Seaborn is used for visualization.
